## Features
### Save-States
Scuffed Save States has the capability to save up to 5 save-states through the use of in-game key binds.
> To create a save-state: Hold `z + 1-5`
> To load a save-state:	Hold `x + 1-5`

Each number from 0 - 5 corresponds to a save slot. To overwrite an old save, simply create a new save-state in its slot.
